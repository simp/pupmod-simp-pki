## Description

This module provides the capability to manage non-Puppet PKI keys that are
hosted on the Puppet server.

The `keydist` directory must have the following structure:

```
  Under `${codedir}/${environment}/modules/#{module_name}/files/keydist/`:
  - cacerts
    - Any X.509 PEM formatted CA certificates that you want to serve to your
      clients. Do NOT hash these certificates. This will be done on the client
      side.
  - <fqdn>
    - cacerts
      - Any X.509 PEM formatted CA certificates that you want to serve to your
        clients. Do NOT hash these certificates. This will be done on the
        client side.
    - <fqdn>.pem -> Client Private Key
    - <fqdn>.pub -> Client Public Key
```

If `$pki` is set to 'simp', the keydist directory will have the same structure,
however it will be located in a separate module path so keys don't get clobbered
when using r10k:
* `/var/simp/environments/${environment}/site_files/pki_files/files/keydist`


### This is a SIMP module

This module is a component of the
[System Integrity Management Platform](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/SIMP),
a compliance-management framework built on Puppet.

If you find any issues, they can be submitted to our
[JIRA](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/) or you can find us on
[HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/ggkCeNuLk).

## Setup

### What simp-pki affects

This module both adds your client X.509 PKI keys to the system at
`/etc/pki/simp/x509/{cacerts,private,public}` and provides the ability to copy those
certificates (or other certificates in the same directory format) into
application spaces.

### Setup Requirements

The main functionality of this module is supported by the use of a Puppet
Server. However, the `pki::copy` functionality may be used without connectivity
to the Puppet Server.

To use the server side functionality, you **must** have a special `keydist`
Puppet share.

The following is the recommended addition to `auth.conf` for realizing this share:

```
# Everyone gets access to the cacerts and mcollective
path ~ ^/file_(metadata|content)/modules/pki/keydist/cacerts
allow *


# Allow access to the keydist space for only the nodes that match via
# certificate name
path ~ ^/file_(metadata|content)/modules/pki/keydist/([^/]+)
allow $2
```

### Beginning with simp-pki

## Usage

To sync certificates to your system, simply include the `pki` class.

```
include '::pki'
```

To copy the certificates into your application space, use the `pki::copy`
define.  By default, the cert source is set to /etc/pki/simp. Three basic
use-cases are described below.

If `$pki` is `true` or `simp`:
- The simp-pki class will be included
- Certificates will be centrally managed, in `/etc/pki/simp_apps`

For example:

```
pki::copy { 'httpd': }
```

This will result in the directory `/etc/pki/simp_apps/httpd/x509` being created with the
`cacerts`, `public`, and `private` subdirectories as specified in the `keydist`
directory.

If `$pki` is false:
- The simp-pki class will not be included
- Certificates will not be centrally managed, and you must specify a `$destination`
- You must ensure the parent directories of `$destination` exist

For example:

```
pki::copy { 'httpd':
  $pki         => false,
  $destination => '/foo/bar'
}
```

This will result in the directory `/foo/bar/pki` being created with the `cacerts`,
`public`, and `private` subdirectories as specified in the `/etc/pki/simp/x509` directory.

To change the source of certificates to be distributed, use the global
pki::source catalyst.
- You must ensure the source directory contains the proper `cacerts`, `public`,
  and `private` subdirectories, in the correct format. Nothing else will get
  copied.

In `some_hieradata.yaml`

```
simp_options::pki::source: /some/other/certs
```

In a manifest

```
pki::copy { 'httpd': }
```

This will result in the directory `/etc/pki/simp_apps/httpd/x509` being created with
the `cacerts`, `public`, and `private` subdirectories as specified in the
`/some/other/certs` directory.
