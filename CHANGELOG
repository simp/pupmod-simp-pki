* Fri Jan 25 2019 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 6.1.1-0
- Moved temporary aggregate CA certs reference files used by
  pki_cert_sync out of the target directory. These temporary
  files were being erroneously processed by the gitlab
  application.

* Fri Jan 25 2019 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 6.1.0-0
- pki_cert_sync type now generates an aggregate CA certificates
  with X.509 certificate headers removed, cacerts_no_headers.pem,
  in addition to the existing aggregate CA certificates file,
  cacerts.pem. This new CA certificates file is useful for
  application that cannot handle certificate headers.
- Add a pki_cert_sync option, ``generate_pem_hash_links``, which controls
  whether pki_cert_sync should generate and maintain the PEM file hash
  links in the target directory. Disabling automatic PEM hash link
  generation is useful if an application is managing those links
  in the target directory, itself.

* Mon Dec 11 2017 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 6.0.2-0
- Ensure that /etc/pki/simp_apps is recursively purged so that old certificates
  are not left on the system
- Adds a new param, `$certname`, that controls the name of the certs in keydist
  that will be copied over. This used to be set to `$facts['fqdn']` without an
  option to change it, now it will default to `$trusted['certname']`

* Thu Jul 06 2017 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 6.0.1-0
- Update puppet dependency and remove OBE pe dependency in metadata.json

* Wed Jan 11 2017 Nick Markowski <nmarkowski@keywcorp.com> - 6.0.0-0
- SIMP certs are now managed in /etc/pki/simp/x509, and application
  certs in /etc/pki/simp_apps/<app_name>/x509.

* Tue Jan 10 2017 Nick Miller <nick.miller@onyxpoint.com> - 6.0.0-0
- Changed default location of keydist certs from the files directory of the pki
  module unless $pki is set to 'simp', when it will pull from pki_files in a
  different module path instead.

* Mon Jan 09 2017 Nick Markowski <nmarkowski@keywcorp.com> - 6.0.0-0
- Set perms on simp_apps to 644/755; apps were being denied access to
  their own certs because they could not access /etc/pki/simp_apps.
- We have made the decision to centralize application certificates
  when simp is managing pki (simp_options::pki => true or 'simp').
  This update re-tools pki::copy to better handle managing certs
  in /etc/pki/simp_apps.

- If a directory is placed in keydist/cacerts, the directory structure is copied
  to pki/cacerts, and all certs in subdirectories are appended to cacerts.pem.
- If a directory is removed from keydist/cacerts, it is now forcibly removed
  from .cacerts_ingress.

* Thu Feb 12 2015 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 4.1.0-4
- Moved things to the new 'simp' environment
- Ensure the requirements on packages are appropriately defined

* Mon Feb 09 2015 Nick Markowski <nmarkowski@keywcorp.com> - 4.1.0-3

  compatibility.

* Thu May 15 2014 Kendall Moore <kmoore@keywcorp.com> - 4.1.0-1
- Updated pki_cert_sync to (re)build a concatenated cacerts.pem file which is
  a bundled file of all valid CA certs in /etc/pki/cacerts.

* Tue Apr 08 2014 Kendall Moore <kmoore@keywcorp.com> - 4.1.0-0

- Removed the pki::pre class as all functionality now exists in the pki class.
- Added spec tests.

* Mon Mar 17 2014 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 3.0.0-0
- Added a pki::copy define for properly copying the entire PKI set to an
  alternate location on the system with proper ordering.
- Rolled the pki::pre class into the main pki class.

* Mon Feb 17 2014 Kendall Moore <kmoore@keywcorp.com> - 2.0.0-6
- Added autorequire to pki_cert_sync for file destination.

* Fri May 31 2013 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 2.0.0-5
- Created a native type to replace the hack set of execs for CA certificate
  synchronization. This is not perfect but it is far faster and better.
  Ideally, the type would be able to pull the files from the Puppet server
  itself. Also, the file resource for '/etc/pki/cacerts' was preserved for
  legacy code notification compatibility.

* Wed Apr 11 2012 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 2.0.0-4
- Moved mit-tests to /usr/share/simp...

- Updated the spec file to not require a separate file list.
- The certificate hash script had errors with cert hashes beginning with a '0'
  as well as hashing on the issuer not the subject. Also, cleaned up the way
  the intermediate directory cleanup is handled.

* Thu Oct 27 2011 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 2.0.0-1
- Updated the PKI module to create a two-step certificate placement so that the
  certificate hashes can be generated on the client. This is done due to RHEL6
  using a different hashing algorithm than RHEL5

* Tue Jan 11 2011 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 2.0.0-0
- Refactored for SIMP-2.0.0-alpha release
