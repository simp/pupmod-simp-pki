* Mon Apr 16 2018 Nick Miller <nick.miller@onyxpoint.com> - 6.0.3-0
- pki::copy's source parameter now accepts any string to allow for use of NSS
  and remote file sources.

* Mon Dec 11 2017 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 6.0.2-0
- Ensure that /etc/pki/simp_apps is recursively purged so that old certificates
  are not left on the system
- Adds a new param, `$certname`, that controls the name of the certs in keydist
  that will be copied over. This used to be set to `$facts['fqdn']` without an
  option to change it, now it will default to `$trusted['certname']`

* Thu Jul 06 2017 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 6.0.1-0
- Update puppet dependency and remove OBE pe dependency in metadata.json

* Wed Jan 11 2017 Nick Markowski <nmarkowski@keywcorp.com> - 6.0.0-0
- SIMP certs are now managed in /etc/pki/simp/x509, and application
  certs in /etc/pki/simp_apps/<app_name>/x509.

* Tue Jan 10 2017 Nick Miller <nick.miller@onyxpoint.com> - 6.0.0-0
- Changed default location of keydist certs from the files directory of the pki
  module unless $pki is set to 'simp', when it will pull from pki_files in a
  different module path instead.

* Mon Jan 09 2017 Nick Markowski <nmarkowski@keywcorp.com> - 6.0.0-0
- Set perms on simp_apps to 644/755; apps were being denied access to
  their own certs because they could not access /etc/pki/simp_apps.
- We have made the decision to centralize application certificates
  when simp is managing pki (simp_options::pki => true or 'simp').
  This update re-tools pki::copy to better handle managing certs
  in /etc/pki/simp_apps.

  to pki/cacerts, and all certs in subdirectories are appended to cacerts.pem.
- If a directory is removed from keydist/cacerts, it is now forcibly removed
  from .cacerts_ingress.

* Thu Feb 12 2015 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 4.1.0-4

- Ensure the requirements on packages are appropriately defined

* Mon Feb 09 2015 Nick Markowski <nmarkowski@keywcorp.com> - 4.1.0-3

* Fri Jun 20 2014 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 4.1.0-2
- Modified code in the pki_cert_sync provider for Ruby 2
  compatibility.

* Thu May 15 2014 Kendall Moore <kmoore@keywcorp.com> - 4.1.0-1
- Updated pki_cert_sync to (re)build a concatenated cacerts.pem file which is
  a bundled file of all valid CA certs in /etc/pki/cacerts.

  alternate location on the system with proper ordering.
- Rolled the pki::pre class into the main pki class.

* Mon Feb 17 2014 Kendall Moore <kmoore@keywcorp.com> - 2.0.0-6
- Added autorequire to pki_cert_sync for file destination.

* Fri May 31 2013 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 2.0.0-5
- Created a native type to replace the hack set of execs for CA certificate
  synchronization. This is not perfect but it is far faster and better.
  Ideally, the type would be able to pull the files from the Puppet server
  itself. Also, the file resource for '/etc/pki/cacerts' was preserved for
  legacy code notification compatibility.

* Wed Apr 11 2012 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 2.0.0-4
- Moved mit-tests to /usr/share/simp...

- Updated the spec file to not require a separate file list.
- The certificate hash script had errors with cert hashes beginning with a '0'
  as well as hashing on the issuer not the subject. Also, cleaned up the way
  the intermediate directory cleanup is handled.

* Thu Oct 27 2011 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 2.0.0-1
- Updated the PKI module to create a two-step certificate placement so that the
  certificate hashes can be generated on the client. This is done due to RHEL6
  using a different hashing algorithm than RHEL5

* Tue Jan 11 2011 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 2.0.0-0
