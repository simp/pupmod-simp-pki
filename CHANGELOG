  from .cacerts_ingress.

* Fri May 31 2013 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 2.0.0-5
- Created a native type to replace the hack set of execs for CA certificate
  synchronization. This is not perfect but it is far faster and better.
  Ideally, the type would be able to pull the files from the Puppet server
  itself. Also, the file resource for '/etc/pki/cacerts' was preserved for
  legacy code notification compatibility.

  the intermediate directory cleanup is handled.

* Thu Oct 27 2011 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 2.0.0-1
- Updated the PKI module to create a two-step certificate placement so that the
  certificate hashes can be generated on the client. This is done due to RHEL6
  using a different hashing algorithm than RHEL5
