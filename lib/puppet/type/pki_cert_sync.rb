  @doc = <<-EOM
    A puppet type for merging the contents of one directory full of X.509 PKI
    certificates into another while hashing the certificates in a manner
    appropriate for use by most Linux applications (Apache, OpenLDAP, etc...).

    Usage:

    pki_cert_sync { '<target_dir>': source => '<source_dir>' }

    Both directories must exist on the local operating system, remote file
    syncing is not supported. File attributes will all be copied from the
    source directory.

    Any SELinux contexts will be preserved on existing files and copied from
    the source files if the destination file does not exist.

      self[:tag] += ['pki']

  newparam(:name, :namevar => true) do

      The target directory into which to place and hash the X.509
      certificates.

      This directory will be left as it was found at the end of the sync just
      in case it is the destination of a recursive file copy with purge
      enabled.

      CAs added locally.
